Two cases:
    case 1:
        the quad is stable, so we can substitute the current values of the sensors
        for the desired values in PIDs
    case 2: (the accelerations/rates of rotation are past the threshold)
        the setpoint will become a combination of 
        pre-set acc/gyros from the excel spreadsheet.
        We need to pass the acc/gyro data through sensfusion update
        and also pass it a custom control_t struct.
        
        
***TODO:
-Ilya + Mace: Need to research on sensfusion update (before and after the calls)
              Become familiar with control_t & sensor_t
-Pat: Ask Ilya and Mace (separately) with two distinct, specific questions 
     on the functions that are executing in the main loop (in stabilizer.c, lines 96-131
