Set the desired pitch (Y) and roll (X) acceleration values to about .075
Set Z acceleration to about 1.1

*The rates of angle change are inversely related to the acceleration.
**Reading the acceleration values and calculating the inversely related gyro values (Ã¤ngles?)

In stabilizer.c, wrap commanderGetSetpoint in #ifdef -> else block, then assign the values to setpoint data type.
(Specifically, the setpoint->attitudeRate.roll/pitch/yaw) 
To do that, we need equivalents of commanderGetActivePitch/Roll/Yaw


TODO:
***Come up with an idea to calculate pitch/yaw/roll (find the file & lines where the values are calculated)
