New Algorithm Ideas/What's Next

Sensor Data that we need/want:
    Accelerometer 
    Gyroscope (Rate of angular change)
    Flight Director? 
    
How to Approach the problem:
    Want to create an algorithm using Acc data/see how well we can use small values from sensor (Plausibility Test)
            *More Experimenting with values, see how they change as quad is hovering stable/ when it drifts (live log test)
            * Where do we want to put the code?
                *Stabalizer.c?
                *Commander.c?
                *Attitude_pid_controller.c?
           
        If (1)
            Create a hook that reads in gyro (Flight Director?) that changes behavior during too much pitch/roll
        Else
            Find new sensor data that is useful to use
               Seek outside help? (Jones?/Elia?)
               Search for new videos/forumn posts of hobbyist to see their methods
