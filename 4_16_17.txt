Where(solved)
    Need to place values for our Accel into the crtpCommanderRpytDecodeSetpoint function call in file name crtp_commander_rypt.c
How
    We know we want to place a conditional into the end of the function call, but what do we place in it? (Doesn't need to change dynamically, always assume stable condition at beginning). 
What
    What values are we inserting and how did we find them? 
        Possible solution-The average values for acceleration in the x/y that we found for a stable flight (great place to start and test results) 
        Look at the formulas in the function call sensfusion6GetEulerRPY, and mimic it in our function call
