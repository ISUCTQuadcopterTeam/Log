Potentially look into position estimation.

When the Z acceleration is more than 1.1/X or Y acceleration is more than .01, trigger the algorithm
When X/Y rate of rotation > 10 or < -10

Required setpoints:
Z acceleration: 1.1; X/Y: .075
????
***TODO:
    ->research mode
    ->setpoint calculation/relations
    ->research althold mode, find out how to track variable in stabalizer.c (or find equivalent solution to enabling/disabling "Hover Mode")
    
Homework: 
Pat/Mace/Ilya:Figure out where to put our own custom setpoints(and what to put in them)
              Find 1 solution to "turning on/off" our own algorithm in real time
