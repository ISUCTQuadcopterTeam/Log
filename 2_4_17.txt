Use alt hold with the custom (our) code?
Figure out exactly what alt hold does. Does it only control the altitude? If so, we could use our own values of acc/rate with the cotrol from alt hold.
(We still need to figure out how to convert acc/rate to pitch/yaw/roll)

***TODO:
    Ilya: look for the formula to figure out the values for pitch/yaw/roll are in to code. If unable, find the pitch/roll/yaw formula + figure out where to plug it in.
    Pat + Mace: look through the files Mace mentioned today and research/follow the functions in the files; find out as much as possible about the functions/data involved.
    Files: cortoller_pid line 35
           attitude_controller_pid 148
           position_controller_pid 181
           (not the exact names of the files)
